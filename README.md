## Pinball Americana

![Powered by Graphos](https://github.com/ColdenCullen/dsa-pinball/raw/master/Graphos/Logo/Logo.png)

A basic (I mean seriously basic, like it doesn't work) pinball game built by [Colden Cullen](https://github.com/ColdenCullen) and [Daniel Jost](https://github.com/PxlBuzzard). The engine and game were created for Data Structures and Algorithms 1 during our second year at Rochester Institute of Technology.

This repository carries historical significance as it is the first implementation of this engine. A bit of history:

* Graphos v1.0 (Fall 2012), the first, just terrible version of the engine.
* [Graphos](https://github.com/ColdenCullen/dsa-pinball) v2.0 (Spring 2013), this second version, featuring lots of new features, such as a usable UI, dynamic object loading, and a (pseudo) maintainable architecture.
* [Project 192](https://github.com/ColdenCullen/Project-192) (Fall 2013), 192 saw double the programmers (two became four), and it is now notorious for us making a game from scratch to use for our final submission in about 10 manhours. A great testament to the power of the engine and the ability to use scripts to quickly add gameplay.
* [Dash](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash) (Spring 2014), a complete rewrite of the engine in [D](http://dlang.org/). The number of developers climbed to six.
